Project Title: “Let's Find Toxic Chemicals!”

Project Goals: 
	Our goal in this project is to firstly index our data so that we can properly analyze and classify connections between toxicity levels and their binary molecular fingerprint. We are using data taken from machine learning methods to identify toxicity levels in special chemicals. Because this data set essentially only consists of two variables (molecular fingerprint and experimental class of toxicity), we are going to index our data and look for any correlations.

Data Breakdown:
	 This data set has a total of 1025 columns; the first 1024 reflect the binary molecular fingerprints taken from different chemicals. The last column returns the experimental class (positive or negative), which tells us whether or not the corresponding fingerprint is extremely positive or not. This dataset was used to develop classification QSAR models for the discrimination of extemely toxic or non toxic chemicals. The molecular fingerprints were calculated for sets of chemicals provided to predict acute oral systemic toxicity for filling regulatory needs
